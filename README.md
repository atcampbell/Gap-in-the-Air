Audio visual projection shown at the Talbot Rice gallery in Edinburgh.

Nonlinear dynamical system created by feedback between nonlinear oscillators, Chua's oscillator and the Horse oscillator (based on Peter Blasser's design http://www. ciat-lonbarde.net/fyrall/paperz/fourses/index.html).

Audio is pulsar synthesis with wavelets created from audio output of the Horse oscillators with parameters modulated from control values from the Chua and Fourses. Visual output is vertex shapes generated from the same parameters. Two shapes are generated from the data points, mirroring each other in form and movement.

Created with Processing and Pure Data, the main application logic is created with Pure Data, the two are linked with OSC.
